# Melbourne Housing Price Prediction

Using the Kaggle Melbourne Housing Prices Dataset, I will explore various aspects associated with developing a robust machine learning model. Topics will include: <br>
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Simple & Comprehensive Model
    * Dealing with missing data
    * Dealing with categorical data
* ML Algorithms, including model features.
    * Decision Tree Regressor
    * Random Forest Regressor
    * Gradient Boosting Regressor
    * XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) Regressor
* Partial Dependence Plots
* Pipelines
* Cross Validation
* Data Leakage
